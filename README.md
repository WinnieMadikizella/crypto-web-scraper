This project is a **Python-based automated web scraper** that collects real-time Bitcoin prices from [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) and stores them in a CSV file with timestamps. It can be scheduled to run periodically, building a **historical dataset of crypto prices**.

## Real-World Relevance  

Think of it like **online shopping**:  
On Jumia or Amazon, you might wait for a phone, laptop, or TV price to drop. Instead of refreshing the page all day, you‚Äôd prefer an **automated system** to track the price for you and notify you when it changes.  

Cryptocurrency works the same way ‚Äî prices change every second. Manually checking them is inefficient. This project solves that problem by:  
- Automatically fetching the latest Bitcoin price  
- Recording **when** the price was collected  
- Building a history of price changes over time  

**Use Cases:**  
- üõí Shoppers waiting for discounts  
- üìà Investors tracking volatile markets  
- üìä Analysts building trend models  
- üè™ Businesses monitoring competitor prices

## What I Did  

1. **Scraping the Data** ‚Äì Used `requests` + `BeautifulSoup` to fetch Bitcoin price & name.  
2. **Automating** ‚Äì Built a loop that checks the price at intervals (like a price alert system).  
3. **Storing** ‚Äì Saved results to CSV, appending instead of overwriting.  
4. **Timestamping** ‚Äì Added a time log so each price has context (when it was collected).

## Thought Process  

- **Problem:** Prices (crypto or products) change rapidly; manual checking is frustrating.  
- **Goal:** Automate monitoring to save time and create a historical record.  
- **Approach:** Start with scraping ‚Üí automate runs ‚Üí store data ‚Üí extend to alerts.

## Problem Solved  

- No more manual refreshing of price pages  
- Data stored in one place for easy tracking  
- Creates historical records to analyze when and how prices change  

Just like a shopper can track Jumia deals, this scraper tracks **Bitcoin prices**, proving how automation makes life **easier and smarter**.
