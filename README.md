## Executive Summary
This project is a **Python-based automated web scraper** that automates the collection of real-time Bitcoin prices from [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) and stores them in a CSV file with timestamps. It can be scheduled to run periodically, building a **historical dataset of crypto prices**. Eliminates manual tracking, builds historical datasets, and enables trend analysis.

**Impact**: Saves users hours of manual checking, creates reliable historical data, and enables informed decision-making for investors, analysts, and businesses.

**Next Steps**: Implement multi-crypto support, real-time alerts via email/WhatsApp, and visualization dashboards for trend insights.

## Business Problem
Cryptocurrency prices fluctuate rapidly, making it difficult for investors, analysts, and businesses to monitor them manually. Constantly refreshing pages is inefficient, error-prone, and time-consuming.

Solution:
- Automatically fetch the latest Bitcoin price
- Timestamp and store historical data
- Build datasets for analysis

Stakeholders: Crypto investors, financial analysts, price-conscious shoppers, and businesses monitoring competitor pricing.

## Real-World Relevance  

Think of it like **online shopping**:  
On Jumia or Amazon, you might wait for a phone, laptop, or TV price to drop. Instead of refreshing the page all day, you‚Äôd prefer an **automated system** to track the price for you and notify you when it changes.  

Cryptocurrency works the same way ‚Äî prices change every second. Manually checking them is inefficient. This project solves that problem by:  
- Automatically fetching the latest Bitcoin price  
- Recording **when** the price was collected  
- Building a history of price changes over time  

**Use Cases:**  
- üõí Shoppers waiting for discounts  
- üìà Investors tracking volatile markets  
- üìä Analysts building trend models  
- üè™ Businesses monitoring competitor prices

## Methodology
1. **Data Scraping**: Python `requests` + `BeautifulSoup` to fetch Bitcoin prices.
2. **Automation**: Script runs periodically, appending results to CSV.
3. **Data Storage**: Structured CSV with timestamps for historical analysis.
4. **Scalability**: Modular code allows multi-crypto support and alert system integration.

Why These Tools: Python‚Äôs requests and BeautifulSoup provide reliable web scraping capabilities, while CSV offers a lightweight, accessible storage solution suitable for iterative analysis.
